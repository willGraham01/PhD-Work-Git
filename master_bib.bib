%Time-Dispersive Behavior as a Feature of Critical Contrast Media, Kirill, Y. Ershova, A.V. Kiselev
%% Homogenisation of critical contrast media via asymptotic analysis of D-to-N map between soft and stiff components. Results in the presence of the soft component making the stiff one act as a time-dispersive medium, and inverting the argument offers a way to construct such media from periodic composites. This is all done on QGs periodic in 1D
