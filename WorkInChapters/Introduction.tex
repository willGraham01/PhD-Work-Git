\chapter{Introduction} \label{ch:Intro}
This chapter should essentially be a lit review, whilst also explaining how we are going to treat the physical systems we want to represent mathematically.

\section{Motivation} \label{sec:ProjectMotivation}
The stuff on photonic fibres, refs to Knight etc.
There is a section of the TFR that did this well - wonder if I can reference that?

\section{Mathematical Treatment of Physical Systems}
This section will explain how the problems we are considering relate to the physical setups we want to represent - the ``modelling assumptions" slide from BUC-XVI presentation again springs to mind.
Will need to talk about Gelfand \& Fourier transformsand their uses, as well as variational problems by Zhikov.
Kuchment and Olaf \& Post will most likely also crop up here, and we should probably also mention quantum graphs too.
May even be worth breaking this section into two - one for just the lit review and the other for how we are going about manipulating the physical setup to make it amiable to modelling, and how we will go about this.

\section{Overview of Research} \label{sec:ReportOverview}
Essentially a commentary on each section of the report, standard ending to the introductory chapter which is effectively an introduction-summary :L.
