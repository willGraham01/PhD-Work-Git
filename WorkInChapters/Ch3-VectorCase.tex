\chapter{Scalar Equations} \label{ch:3VectorEqns}
This file should include the work on vector-curl equations, and have a similar sort of feel to it as the scalar case. Indeed, it should even refer back to the previous section and draw the appropriate parallels.

\section{Setup and Review of Notation}

\section{The Vector Sobolev Spaces}

\section{Curls of Zero - An Example}
This should be the ``everything is a curl of zero" example.

\section{A Waveguide Problem}
The $k$-curls stuff and getting to the edge equations.
