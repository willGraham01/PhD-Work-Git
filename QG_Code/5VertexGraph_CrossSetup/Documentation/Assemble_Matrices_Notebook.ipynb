    "## Assemble Matrices Script\n",
    "\n",
    "This script will assemble the two stiffness matrices that we need for the analysis of the spectrum of\n",
    "$$ -\\nabla^2 u = \\omega^2 u $$\n",
    "on our (thin-structure) cross domain $\\Omega$.\n",
    "The weak form of this equation is\n",
    "$$ \\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla u \\cdot \\nabla \\phi - \\omega^2 u \\phi \\ \\mathrm{d}x = 0.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This domain consists of $N$ period cells along each axis (for a total of $N^2$ cells), each of size $1\\times 1$.\n",
    "Tube widths are taken as $h = \\frac{1}{2N}$, whilst the radii of the circles is $r = \\sqrt{\\frac{h}{\\alpha\\pi}}$, where $\\alpha\\in\\mathbb{R}$ is (a proxy for) the coupling constant which appears in the singular-structure limit problem.\n",
    "**NOTE:** This assumes $\\alpha \\approx \\frac{V_{edge}}{V_{vertex}}$ - this fraction may be reversed in other places of our work!\n",
    "\n",
    "What will be done is the stiffness matrices $A_1$ and $A_2$ for $\\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla u \\cdot \\nabla \\phi \\ \\mathrm{d}x$ and $\\int_{\\Omega} u \\phi \\ \\mathrm{d}x$ (respectively) will be assembled and saved.\n",
    "Then, we can pass these to another script to compute the eigenvalues $\\omega^2$ of the generalised eigenvalue problem\n",
    "$$ \\left( A_1 + \\omega^2 A_2 \\right)u = 0,$$\n",
    "and unpack the solutions $u$.\n",
    "**NOTE:** The $-$ sign is _not_ included in the stiffness matrix for $A_2$!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements:\n",
    "- This script requires the fenicsproject environment to be active\n",
    "- This script requires the following subdirectories be available: `./StiffnessMatrixDump/`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outputs:\n",
    "- Stiffness matrix files stored in the directory `./StiffnessMatrixDump/`, under the naming convention `a1_N*.npz` and `a2_N*.npz` where `*` is replaced by the value of $N$ being used."
