    "During the various runs, we will create several mesh files.\n",
    "We will need to preserve these when we later want to plot the eigenfunctions that we have found, and so we should create a copy of each mesh before \"cleanup\" occurs in `./FEM_CrossGraphSolve.sh` and the meshes are removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "We move the most recently created mesh file to the folder `MeshDump` and use a familiar naming convention of `Mesh-N*.xml` where `*` is replaced by the value of $N$ being used in the `.geo` file passed to gmsh.\n",
    "**NOTE:** We don't check to see whether such a mesh file is already saved, and this is in case we update our `.geo` file later and thus create meshes with different simplexes - we want the records of these meshes to always change with these mesh changes."
