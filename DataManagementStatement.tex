\section*{Data Management Statement}

The research project ``Asymptotic and Numerical Analysis of Wave Propagation in Photonic Fibres with a Thin-Structure Cladding" will not require the use of any datasets; real or synthetic, nor the use of commercial software.

The extent of purpose for any numerical code that will be produced during the project is to validate/test/probe theoretical results, and produce diagrams for illustrative purposes.
