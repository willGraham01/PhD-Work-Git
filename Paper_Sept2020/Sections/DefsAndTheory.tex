\section{Definitions and Theory} \label{sec:DefsAndTheory}

In this section we will (lightly) review the definitions and theory that we will need to obtain our effective equations on a graph.
We need to be prudent in terms of length - don't include all the lengthy proofs and technical details, nor every definition.
We'll also need to talk about both quantum/metric graphs and the Sob-spaces stuff here, as we don't intend to introduce anything new in the next section (only to recall theory here and explain how our equations are derived).
