\section{Effective System and Analysis} \label{sec:SystemAndAnalysis}

Here the intention is to explain how we arrive at the system of equations for a singular structure problem from our measure theoretic formulation.
We recall theory from the previous sections of the paper to do this, and then proceed to discuss our numerical schemes and demonstrate band-gap structures and other conjectures we have made.
