Text file to store commands for using Git in the command line; and for proper use so that I don't screw anything up!

git init : initialises a git repository
git config --global options : once per computer, configures the global option (applies to all git repositories on the computer)
git config --list : will list all the set options on this machine

git status : lists the status of the current repository. Will highlight anything that warrants attention.
"Untracked files" - files in the repository that git is not tracking. Can be added with the "add" command.

git add : add the listed file(s) to the git repository for tracking. Need to do this before a commit to save the changes to any modified files.
Can cal git add by feeding in a directory, to speed up multiple file changes!

git commit : commits changes made to tracked files in the repository.
git commit -m "message" : will assign a message to this commit to remind yourself of what you did.
Running git commit without this optional flag will bring up the default text editor so that you can write a longer message.
git log : can be used to remind yourself of the previous commits.
git diff : lists the changes made from the previous commit (checkpoint) to those that will be committed in the next git commit command call.
