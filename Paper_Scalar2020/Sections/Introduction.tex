\section{Introduction} \label{sec:Intro}

This section includes our literature review and motivation.
The purpose of the paper is to present the equations that were derived for the curl-curl system as what can be interpreted as an "effective" or "limit" problem for a fine/thin-structure material.
This is subject to future advances in the field that draw parallel to the scalar-case developments, of course.
