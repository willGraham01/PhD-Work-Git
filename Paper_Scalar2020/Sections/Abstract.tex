\tstk{this might need a second look?}
We develop a mathematical framework for the study of wave propagation in two-dimensional photonic crystals whose cross-sections are well approximated by ``graph-like" structures. 
We study spectral properties of such structures for various types of coupling conditions at the junctions between the graph edges, in the case of transverse polarisation, when either the electric or magnetic field is aligned with the crystal.
